# About me

Hi, I'm Doria! 👋 I'm 25 years old, and I'm from France. I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics (NLP), where I focus on Artificial Intelligence and the study of emotions in language processing.  

🌸 Beyond my studies, I take great interest in art, gaming, and societal causes.


## What you'll find here
💻 This GitHub features a mix of projects from my academic journey and personal explorations (mostly in French, sorry!). You'll find Python scripts, PHP applications and web development projects.  


## Let's connect?
🤝 I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas or new projects!
